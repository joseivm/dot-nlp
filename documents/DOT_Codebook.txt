     The Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT) is a comprehensive manual      
which defines occupations in the United States and its territories.  Within     
the associated electronic media is the DOT manual.  The electronic media        
you received contains textual and "database" files.                             
                                                                                
     The text files are named:

     These files relate directly to section's of the printed manual.  They      
contain introductory material, descriptions of the data itself, and             
descriptions of how to use the information as shown in the printed version.     
                                                                                
The Appendices (APDX1 thru APDX5) and Parts of the Definition (PARTS) files     
can provide you with a better understanding of the DOT data and linguistic      
terms used to describe the data.  While working with the electronic media       
version, we recommend you use, for additional guides, printed copies of the     
DOT and the Handbook for Analyzing Jobs, 1991 (HAJ). Both printed references    
are available from the Superintendent of Documents through a United States      
Printing Office Bookstore.  The HAJ contains definitions of the contents of     
most of the data fields in the DOT Definition Database (see pages 6 - 8).       
                                                                                
     All other files contain data that was used to create the heart of the      
DOT manual.  The data in these files was extracted from the Occupational        
Analysis Field Center mini-computer DOT databases.  Each database file has      
an associated record layout which may be found in the following pages.          
These "database" files are not simple text files.                               
                                                                                
     When looking at the individual record layouts and database files the       
following should be noted:                                                      
                                                                                
          --    A document number, not DOT code, is used as the "key" which     
                relates records together between files.                         
                                                                                
          --    All files consist of fixed length records.

          --    If you ordered the manual on IBM 9-track tape media, then       
                files which were broken into smaller sizes for the PC are       
                combined into a single file.  Therefore the sequential          
                numbering is not applicable nor is the .ASC file extension.     
                                                                                
          --    The "Conversion Tables" publication provides a crosswalk        
                between definition codes and/or titles which changed, were      
                deleted, or were added between publication of the fourth        
                edition Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT), 1977 and       
                the revised fourth edition DOT, 1991.  Please note that         
                information other than codes and titles may have changed for    
                any occupation. Therefore, the "Conversion Tables" are not      
                an exhaustive list of all definitions which experienced a       
                revision to one or more fields.

There is one record for each title in the printed "Alphabetical Index of        
Occupational Titles."  The "Occupational Titles Arranged by Industry            
Designation" can be created by sorting on the four DOT Industry fields.         
Document Numbers are used more than once in these files.  Therefore, record     
uniqueness is obtained through a composite field of Title, Designation1,        
Designation2, Designation3, and Designation4 rather than through Document       
Number.
