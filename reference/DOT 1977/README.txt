The files in this folder contain master definitions for the 1977 Dictionary of Occupational Titles. These are general titles that are often referenced by more specific titles. For example, "APPRENTICE" is a master title that is reference by the more specific title "ELECTRICIAN APPRENTICE". The original transcribed version of the 1977 DOT, 1977_Output.txt did not contain these definitions, so we manually added them later.
